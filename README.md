## Abstract
Cross-situational word learning (CSWL) is a form of statistical learning where learners gradually learn word-object associations based on the co-occurrence of word and referent only. Theories disagree on how multiple meanings for words are acquired and compete during acquisition. Thus, we investigated real-time competition for multiple simultaneously acquired overlapping mappings during CSWL via eye-tracking. Participants (N = 40) acquired six 1:1 (one word to one object) and six 1:2 (one word to two objects) mappings. In each trial, they saw one word and three objects while being eye-tracked, and their task was to select the target. Notably, for 1:2 mappings, the two correct referents never appeared on the same trial. Eye movements to targets were fit to a four-point (upper and lower asymptote, slope and cross-over point) logistic, allowing us to estimate how competition impacts specific timing components of referent activation for different mapping types. In line with our predictions, preliminary results show that 1:2 mappings are harder to learn and have a lower upper asymptote than 1:1 ones, indicating that multiple referents compete across trials. In a second experiment, we will explore these learning differences in detail.
